# Gatekeep
Everyone who joins the server after your key expires will get disconnected when you send a chat message. This can be done in vanilla because 1.19.1 is a well made update, but Gatekeep manages your keys and tells you when it is possible to kick people. This could be used to kick the entire server, by slowing down a connection just as your key expires, but that's beyond the scope of this proof of concept.
